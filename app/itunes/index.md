    <h2>Skip Terrible Music</h2>
    <p>Denied sees what you're playing in iTunes and automatically skips songs that you dislike.</p>
    <p>Tracks can be skipped by their artist, title or album, allowing you to truly enjoy your music collection, without listening to live versions or those songs you can't stand.</p>
