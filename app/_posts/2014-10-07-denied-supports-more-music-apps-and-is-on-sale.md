Denied's first update is now available. In addition to Spotify, you can now automatically skip tracks in [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com) and iTunes as well! It also features an improved add-rule-flow that lets you create new rules much faster.

Get the update from [the Mac App Store](/appstore), or by checking for updates in <a href="{{ site.urls.download }}" class="download" rel="nofollow">the trial version</a>.

If you couldn't decide whether to get the full version of Denied, I've just made that decision a lot easier: 

Denied is on sale for a limited time for just [$2.99](/appstore), down from $6.99!
